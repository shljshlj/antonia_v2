          <div class="about__text">
            <p>
              My name is Antonia Stipic. I am a childcare worker with a multi-disciplinary education background and an
              interest in working as a child care worker in the Berlin metropolitan area. I come from Split, a beautiful
              city on the Adriatic coast, Croatia.
            </p>
            <p>
              Being a sea lover and a part-time sailor I've traveled the world. I was also lucky to have opportunities
              to
              work with children in many of those countries I've visited.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe that every child has huge potential and I enjoy working with them to overcome challenges. I have
              experience working with children with physical and developmental disabilities. Practicing respect, good
              communication and hard work I have witnessed great transformations in children I have worked with; I would
              like to think that my work was part of those positive changes.
